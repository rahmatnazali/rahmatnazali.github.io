I found out that GitHub is holding annual game jam called **Game Off**, where people try to create a game
on the month of November for a certain predetermined theme.

Personally, I think one month is a very short time to make a game that excel in all key components: 
playable, reliable (no game-breaking bug), fun, immersive.

I've always been interested in GameDev, so I thought I'd give it a try.

Since I've mostly used python in the past years, I picked Godot Engine. 
The open-source license is also a plus, as basically I can own both the game engine and the game I've created, royalty-free.

This year's [Game Off 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023){:target="_blank"} theme is 'SCALE'.

Naturally, I'm not aiming to be the #1 developer, but rather to demonstrate 
whether I could create & finish something that are playable, with optimization and immersion deliberately left behind.

In around 16 days, I [coded](https://github.com/rahmatnazali/colonite){:target="_blank"} a simple unit simulation with a generic finite state machine.
The unit can switch its state according to the surrounding situation, and we (the user) basically just watching them going against each other.

To give some gamification, I added resource to spawn the unit, and declare a goal to get rid all the other team, and that's it.

It's a downloadable executable file:

Going for a solo indie game developer may be a nice idea, even though I know the path would be harsh.
May this very first project lays the stepping stone towards it.
