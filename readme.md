This is the code for my GitHub Pages.

I left this code open in case some people want to have the same. It's entirely free personal site.

Step by step on how to create this site has been documented on [my article](https://rahmatnazali.github.io/2023/08/02/creating-hassle-free-and-markdown-based-blog-with-jekyll.html).
