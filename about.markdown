Hi and welcome to my personal blog! ðŸ˜Š

This is the best place for me to document all of my findings that I found interesting during my whole life 
as a Software Developer - and as the head of our small family.

You will find some tech articles and occasionally some life-related experiences. 
Trying my best not to include the boring one.

The code of this blog is kept open in [this repository](https://github.com/rahmatnazali/rahmatnazali.github.io){:target="_blank"}, so feel free to use it or contact me for any discussion!
