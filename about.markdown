Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my dead simple personal blog!

This would be the place for me to documents all of my findings that I found interesting during my whole life 
as a Software Developer - and as the head of our small family.

You will find some tech articles and occasionally some life-related experiences (I hope not the boring one).

The code of this blog is kept open [here](https://github.com/rahmatnazali/rahmatnazali.github.io){:target="_blank"}, feel free to use it or contact me for any discussion!
